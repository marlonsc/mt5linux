"""Async MetaTrader5 client for mt5linux.

Native gRPC async client using grpc.aio for non-blocking MT5 operations.
No asyncio.to_thread() - pure async gRPC calls.

Example:
    >>> async with AsyncMetaTrader5(host="localhost", port=50051) as mt5:
    ...     await mt5.initialize(login=12345)
    ...     account = await mt5.account_info()
    ...     rates = await mt5.copy_rates_from_pos("EURUSD", mt5.TIMEFRAME_H1, 0, 100)

Thread Safety:
    The async client uses grpc.aio for true async operations.
    Multiple concurrent coroutines can safely make requests in parallel.
    HTTP/2 connection multiplexing allows efficient concurrent operations.

Resilience Features (opt-in via config):
    - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
    - Background health monitoring
    - Circuit breaker for cascading failure prevention

Compatible with grpcio 1.60+ and Python 3.13+.

"""

# RESILIENCE LAYER ARCHITECTURE
# =============================
# To avoid circular dependencies, operations are split into 3 layers.
# Layer 3 has resilience, Layer 2 is used BY resilience (no retry),
# Layer 1 is direct gRPC connection. Rule: Layer N calls N-1 or lower only.
