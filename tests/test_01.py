"""
Basic connection test for the MetaTrader5 Linux integration.

This test verifies that the MetaTrader5 class can be instantiated and
basic methods can be called. It requires a running MetaTrader5 server.

Note: This test is meant to be run manually after starting the server
with the appropriate port (1235).
